Over the past decade, reading proficiency among U.S. students has slipped in worrying ways. I think it's important to explore the what and why this is happening. Why is it important to read above grade level? Reading texts more complex than one’s current grade promotes growth in vocabulary, background knowledge, inference skills, and syntactic processing. The cognitive drivers are: 


1. Decoding fluency (accurate, automatic word recognition) 

2. Vocabulary and background knowledge (which unlocks comprehension) 

3. Comprehension strategies (summarizing, questioning, monitoring understanding).

Intervention guides from the U.S. Institute of Education Sciences (IES) and literacy researchers emphasize building decoding + fluency + comprehension in tandem to move students up grade bands.

**Data**

Measurable drops in reading proficiency are recorded by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP, also known as "The Nation's Report Card"). Both fourth- and eighth-grade pupils' average reading scores decreased between 2019 and 2022; 2024 NAEP findings reveal additional drops at both grades when compared to 2022. In summary, several cohorts have seen a reversal in their reading development, and the declines are widespread across percentiles, with the largest losses occurring below the 90th percentile.  


A cultural trend away from leisure reading is indicated by additional research: Daily reading for pleasure has significantly decreased over the past 20 years, according to time-use studies. This decline is concentrated in certain demographic groups and may have an impact on children's early literacy exposure. The NAEP changes are probably explained by a combination of pandemic learning interruptions and a decrease in reading for pleasure.

**Comparison by year**

 • Pre-2019 baseline: Gradual improvements in many places, but persistent achievement gaps by income and race. 
 • 2019 → 2022: NAEP reading scores for grades 4 and 8 fell (2022 averaged about 3 points lower than 2019).  
 • 2022 → 2024: Further declines (another ~2 points at grade 4 and grade 8 nationally), with more pronounced drops at lower percentiles. Experts describe these changes as “sobering,” noting that 12th-grade testing in 2024 revealed declines too. 

The information points to a multi-year issue rather than a one-year anomaly. This implies that both remediation (evidence-based interventions in elementary and middle school) and prevention (early childhood exposure) are important.

**Books to read by grade level to advance your reading level** 

Below are suggested titles and types of books that push students toward more complex texts. Use these lists as stretch reading (read most of the book independently and discuss challenging chapters with a mentor). Sources for age-appropriate recommendations include public-library curated lists and educator resources.  

  •K–2 (build narrative skills & vocabulary) 

Picture books with rich language and repeating structures: *Where the Wild Things Are* (Sendak), *If You Give a Mouse a Cookie* 

Early chapter transition: *Charlotte’s Web* (E. B. White) — good stretch around grade 2 for strong readers. 


  •Grades 3–5 (bridge to longer narratives & themes) 

*Charlotte’s Web* (if not read earlier), *Holes* (Louis Sachar), *Wonder* (R. J. Palacio), more nonfiction bios and narrative science pieces. 

These books build inference, theme analysis, and multi-chapter comprehension. Library grade lists and classroom guides are excellent here.


  •Grades 6–8 (deepen inference, background knowledge, multiple perspectives) 

*The Giver* (Lois Lowry), *The Outsiders* (S. E. Hinton), selected works from YA historical fiction and contemporary realistic fiction, plus short nonfiction essays on current events. 

Focus on annotation, discussing character motives, and tracing argument structure in nonfiction. 


  •Grades 9–12 (move toward classic & complex modern texts) 

Canon + modern: *To Kill a Mockingbird* (Harper Lee), *1984* (George Orwell), *The Great Gatsby* (F. Scott Fitzgerald), alongside contemporary YA novels and high-quality longform journalism. 

For stretch reading, add nonfiction books on history, science, or memoirs that expand background knowledge and vocabulary. Library recommended reading lists and Common Sense Media provide age filters and content notes.  

 

**How to use these books as stretch texts:**

•Pre-teach 8–12 high-utility words per chapter. 

•Read aloud difficult passages and model annotation. 

•Assign short evidence-based writing tasks (defend a character’s choice with quotes). 

•Use book clubs or literature circles to promote complex discussion (Shanahan and Reading Rockets discuss options for above-grade readers).

**How to challenge your brain and What books are good to start with** 

Research and practitioner guides converge on actionable, measurable approaches: 

1. Systematic decoding practice — strengthen phonics and multisyllabic word reading so complex words stop blocking comprehension. (IES recommends building decoding first when weaknesses exist.)
 

2. Fluency drills — timed repeated reading, paired reading, and oral reading with feedback improve speed without sacrificing accuracy.
 

3. Knowledge-building nonfiction — reading domain-rich nonfiction (science, history) builds the background knowledge that makes fiction and complex arguments easier to understand.
   

4. “Stretch text” routines — scaffolded reading of grade-above materials: pre-teach vocabulary, use guided questions, and provide short comprehension checks. The IES practice guide and literacy organizations recommend these for grades 4–9.


5. Regular independent reading + accountable talk — students who read more and discuss readings with peers/mentors build stamina and interpretive skills. Time-use declines in reading for pleasure make this step even more crucial.

**Literary Merit**

“Challenging” doesn’t mean obscure. Literary merit for stretch reading includes: dense but clear language, layered themes, historical or cultural knowledge that rewards rereading, and opportunities for analytical writing. When choosing books, evaluate: vocabulary demands, sentence complexity, required background knowledge, and opportunities for classroom or club discussion. Resources from librarians (NYPL) and educators (Reading Rockets, Shanahan) help pick texts that are both rich and teachable.

**Classes to take in high school** 

If your goal is to read above grade level and prepare for college-level texts, consider these courses and why they help: 

•AP English Language & Composition — explicit instruction in rhetorical analysis, argumentation, and nonfiction close reading. The course emphasizes reading to analyze a writer’s choices, which strengthens critical reading.  


•AP English Literature & Composition — sustained engagement with complex literary texts, close textual analysis, and timed analytical writing. Useful for deeper literary understanding and stamina.  


•Honors or dual-enrollment humanities / composition courses — exposure to college writing expectations and diverse, content-rich readings improves reading transfer. Research shows advanced coursework can raise readiness, especially when paired with equitable access and strong instruction.  


•Electives that build knowledge (AP U.S. History, AP Biology, Economics, World History) — subject-matter knowledge increases comprehension of related nonfiction and fiction texts.  


**Note:** taking APs alone is not magic—high-quality instruction and scaffolded reading matter most. Access and equity issues also affect who gets the benefits of advanced coursework.

**Conclusion** 

The decline in national reading scores is a call to action, not a fatalism. Science-backed routines—decoding work, fluency building, knowledge-rich reading, and scaffolded “stretch” texts—help students climb above grade level. Libraries and curated book lists supply age-appropriate, high-quality texts; classroom structures and advanced courses can sustain growth. If we combine deliberate instruction, regular independent reading, and access to complex texts, students can regain reading stamina and deepen comprehension—one book (and one scaffolded discussion) at a time.
