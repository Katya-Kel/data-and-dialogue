What is medical physics?

Medical physics is where physics, medicine, and computer science come together. In order to improve diagnosis and treatment, it combines the use of cutting-edge technology like radiation therapy and imaging systems with computer science methods like data analysis and machine learning. In order to improve the accuracy and personalization of healthcare, medical physicists frequently create software, work with algorithms, and oversee big collections of medical data.
With a base in physics and an emphasis on medical applications, medical physics is a separate science. The technical underpinnings of radiology, radiation oncology, nuclear medicine, and radiation safety are provided by medical physics.

Why is it important?

Reasonable question, let's get into why medical physics is important! The main reason being that it brings a lot more precision to medicine. It has become increasingly important for its usefulness in aiding doctors for diagnosis without cutting into the body. With every dose of radiation and a clear scan there is a Medical Physicist making sure it is safe and accurate. Without this fastly developing field, healthcare would be a much slower and risk drenched process.

How is it currently being used in research?

Medical Physics is currently playing an important role in research, most notably in fields like cancer treatment and medical imaging. Radiologists and Scientists have come together to use computer models and advanced physics to make radiation therapy more precise. Protecting healthy tissue while simultaneously targeting the tumors. Additionally, AI is coming together with scanning technology like CT scans and MRIs to increase precision in early detection, with the help of doctors staying as supervisor AI is capable of making cancer detection a faster and more precise process. 

Possible paths to get into Medical Physics:

	Undergraduate:
Physics
Engineering Physics
Radiological Science
Biomedical Engineering
Nuclear Engineering
Any one of these would be great to build a solid base for Medical Physics. With some additional coursework, these would also work:
Computer Science
Biology or Pre-Med track
Electrical Engineering
Mathematics

	Graduate School:
To work in a clinical setting in the U.S. you must graduate from a CAMPEP program (Commission on Accreditation of Medical Physics Educational Programs.) Here are the some options:
Ph.D. in Medical Physics- If you want to combine research and clinical practice with academia.
M.S. in Medical Physics- If received from a CAMPEP program, is the most straightforward route into clinical medical physics. Though, it must be followed with residency.
M.S./Ph.D. in Physics, Biomedical Engineering + CAMPEP Certificate- For those whose programs are not CAMPEP certified and can still qualify for a 1 year postgrad CAMPEP certification.
DMP(Doctor of Medical Physics)- Is a combination of M.S. and residency into a 4 year doctorate. Less common.

	
Residency:
Clinical- 2 years at a CAMPEP institution, rule for ABR board certification.
Board Certification- Given by American Board of Radiology (ABR) this is required to practice as a Medical Physicist in a hospital.

You can also do medical research in a non-clinical way! This could be: software development, research, industry. All of the previously listed can be done without board certification. In this case, a degree in computer science or biomedical engineering with medical applications is sufficient. No clinical residency is needed if you are not working directly with patients or hospital equipment.	     


Career possibilities:

Medical Physics is a field with many possibilities. If you find yourself wondering, “What job could I get with this complex degree?” you are not alone! In this vast field with many interconnected disciplines, there are a plethora of job opportunities out there if you're willing to look!
Here is just a few:
Clinical Medical Physicist
Research Scientist
Medical Imaging & AI Developer
Biomedical Engineer(With possible additional training)
Machine Learning Engineer

Summer Programs(Highschool & Undergraduate):

	Highschool:
MIT PRIMES- Offers lab experience and mentorship   
National Institute of Health (NIH)- Summer Internship Program (SIP)
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory(Fermilab)- Summer internships
For more information visit American Association of Physicists in Medicine for occasional information on summer internships.

Undergraduate:
REU(Research Experience for Undergraduates)- Offered by many universities such as University of Wisconsin-Madison, Oregon State University and University of Texas. Allows for students to experience medical physics or biomedical engineering.
Stanford University (Summer Research Program) - Physical experience in a lab under faculty mentorship.
Johns Hopkins University (Summer Internship in Medical Physics) - Research in radiation therapy and imaging.

History of medical physics:
	If you are anything like me then you love to know the history of how things come to be. The history behind Medical Physics is relatively short but very interesting (to say the least.) So, I have compiled a brief timeline of the evolution of Medical Physics.
Timeline:
		1895- Wilhelm Röntgen discovers X-Ray
X-Rays are invisible radiation waves that pass through the body during medical imaging to create images of bones and organs. This was the start of medical imaging.
		1896- First medical use of X-rays
Doctors begin using x-rays to detect broken bones and to find any foreign objects (such as bullets.)
		1898- Marie and Pierre Curie discover radium and polonium
These newly discovered radioactive elements later led to the development of radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is controlled radiation to help battle cancer.
(In a future post we will discuss more of Marie Curie's contributions to science and her importance as a woman in STEM.)
		1901- First Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to Röntgen
Granted for his discovery of the X-ray.
		1913- William D. Coolidge invents the Coolidge tube.
Allowed for a more safe and accurate medical image.
		1950s- Growth of Clinical Medical Physics
Medical physicists become an official role in major hospitals, making their mark in diagnostic imaging and radiation therapy.
		1971- First CT scan by Godfrey Hounsfield
CT, short for Computed Tomography, is a combination of X-rays and computers to create a 3D image of the body.
		1979- Hounsfield is awarded Nobel Prize
Granted for his development of CT scans.
		1980s- MRI becomes widely used
MRI, short for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, uses a big strong magnet and radio waves to make detailed images of softer tissues, like the brain.
		1990s- Digital imaging and CAD
CAD, or Computer-Aided Diagnosis, uses computer algorithms to help radiologists analyze medical images. This is the start of computers playing a bigger role in medical images.
2000s- Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT)
A combination of radiation treatment of cancers and imaging, more accurate targeting of tumors.
		2010s- Rise of AI and Machine Learning in Medical Physics
Machine learning is basically the process of computers learning patterns from large amounts of data so they can make better predictions during diagnosis. During this period AI begins helping in image analysis and assisting radiologists in treatment planning.
		2020s- Development in personalized medicine and AI for Diagnosis
Medical physicists collaborate with data scientists to help create a more personal treatment for people with help from a larger base of medical data.
