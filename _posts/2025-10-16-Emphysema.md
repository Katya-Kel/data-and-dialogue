# The Silent Suffocation: How Emphysema Steals Your Breath

Breathlessness is a symptom of the chronic lung disease Emphysema. The disease gradually weakens the alveoli, which are the lungs' thin walls of air sacs. When you breathe in, these sacs expand and fill with air in healthy lungs. When you exhale, the air is assisted by the elastic sacs. However, emphysema makes it difficult to expel air from your lungs due to damage to the air sacs. This prevents oxygen-rich, fresh air from getting into your lungs. 

**Types of Emphysema:**

Centrilobular Emphysema (CLE):  

The most common kind of emphysema, particularly in smokers. The secondary pulmonary lobule center, which is close to the tiny airways known as respiratory bronchioles, is where damage starts. The lungs' upper lobes are typically the first and most seriously impacted. Shown on CT as tiny, low-density focal regions surrounding the lobule center. It is frequently linked to persistent bronchitis.

Panlobular Emphysema (PLE): 

						 
The entire lobule, not just the center, is uniformly destroyed. More widespread and typically has a more profound effect on the lungs' lower lobes. Although it can also happen in severe smoking-related diseases, it is frequently associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a genetic illness.Large, homogeneous patches of low lung density with no normal tissue in between are visible on CT scans.

Paraseptal Emphysema (PSE)  
		 

The distal portion of the lobule, near the pleura (the lungs outer membrane) and interlobular septa (the walls between lobules), is where the majority of the damage occurs. It frequently impacts the upper lobes' outer borders. It shows up on CT as subpleural low-density gaps, which can occasionally develop bullae, which are huge, air-filled areas. It can happen in conjunction with other forms of emphysema and is occasionally linked to spontaneous pneumothorax, or lung collapse.

Emphysema by the Numbers: 


An estimated 3.1 million Americans have been diagnosed with emphysema, and 11.2 million with COPD. In the United States, about 147,382 people died of COPD last year. Specifically, emphysema accounts for about 7,905 deaths. Globally, there's an estimated amount of 251 million cases of COPD. About 3.23 million people die of COPD worldwide each year.

Why is early detection important?    


Emphysema causes irreparable lung damage over time, thus early detection is essential. Physicians can reduce its progression, maintain lung function, and enhance quality of life by detecting it early.  



●  Early in the disease, lifestyle modifications like stopping smoking and avoiding lung irritants are most successful.   

●  Early initiation of oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, and medication can decrease symptoms and hospital stays.     

●  Patients who receive an early diagnosis are also better able to plan and manage their health before serious complications arise.

Evolution of Emphysema over time 


The COPDGene study, which was a study done over a 10-year period on emphysema progression, controlled for individual CT data, revealed that the greatest decrease in adjusted lung density occurred in those with pre-existing emphysema who continued to smoke. A prospective study of 8431 smokers, both present and former, who had quantitative CT examination for a maximum of 10 years revealed a correlation between the progression of emphysema and initial emphysema grade and smoking status.

COPD(In relation to emphysema) 


A collection of lung conditions known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) impede airflow. As a result, breathing becomes more challenging. COPD is the umbrella term for asthmatic bronchitis, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis. According to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), COPD ranks as the third leading cause of death in the US. By 2030, COPD is expected to rank as the third most common cause of death globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). As well as up to 15.7 million Americans reported having COPD as of 2014, according to the CDC. How to Avoid COPD? Physicians have made significant contributions to our understanding of the etiology, diagnosis, and course of COPD over the years. The long-term prognosis for COPD is better the earlier it is diagnosed. COPD cannot be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled, and those who have it can have better lives overall.
