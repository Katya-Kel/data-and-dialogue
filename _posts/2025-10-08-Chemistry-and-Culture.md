**Introduction:**  


Culture and where people are located impacts how fermentation is used  

and what is created using fermentation. Many parts of Asia have their own unique style of 

fermentation and a unique cultural significance. Fermentation is a chemical and biological 

process that has existed for thousands of years. It has evolved with humans and exists in 

many popular foods eaten today. Most people don't even think about how much 

fermentation is involved with life. Culture, chemical and biological processes play a huge 

role in fermentation and its development. These themes will be explored in more detail 

moving forward. Exploring cultural background and the impact of location on fermentation 

will be insightful in developing a further understanding of the importance of fermentation 

today. When food is scarce, especially in northern and colder regions, people turn to 

fermenting their food which allows it to stay preserved and feeds the people during cold 

and harsh climate conditions. This has kept more people alive and keeps people from 

starvation. Fermentation is essential for human health and should be treated with respect. 

The materials that are required for fermenting cabbage are: cabbage, carrots, a knife, 

cutting board, cheese cloth, weight, bowl, jars that can be sealed, storage space. Most 

people try to store their fermented food in a seller, so it is not exposed to sunlight and other 

harmful environmental factors. 

  

**Steps to fermentation:** 

 

Cabbage and carrots are finely cut up; a necessary solution of salt 

and water is combined to complete fermentation of cabbage. The cabbage and carrot are 

mashed up and deposited into a bowl. It is kneaded with salt to allow the juices to flow and 

crush cabbage structures. Later, it is weighed down for a week at room temperature and is 

left alone. After it can be enjoyed or canned and put in the fridge. Different concentrations 

of salt and when the cabbage mass is put at different temperatures the flavor profile and 

time needed to ferment is impacted. Multiple things go into fermentation, and it is key to 

know the history and cultural significance to better understand the art of fermentation. 

History plays a significant role because of the way human societies have changed as more 

access to technology and luxury items like fridges. These new inventions have impacted 

cultural traditions that have lasted thousands of years because people no longer seek or 

use methods their grandparents and great grandparents have used to preserve and eat 

food (3). 

 

**Process:**

 

Many things work together to make fermented cabbage or sauerkraut. To begin 

with the components that act to create fermented cabbage. Salt acts as a catalyst, it not 

only enhances flavor it also enhances the growth of the beneficial bacteria in the cabbage. 

The star of this recipe is cabbage, a versatile vegetable that is packed with nutrients. 

Traditionally green cabbage is used. Fermentation takes time which makes it an art as 

much as a science. The massaging and releasing of juices through the breakage of cellular 

structure (3). This is the hands-on part of this experiment. The anaerobic environment is 

important for the growth of lactic acid bacteria, which are responsible for fermenting the 

cabbage. Weighing the cabbage down is essential and leaving it at room temperature is 

essential for fermentation (3). Sauerkraut is good for probiotics and yeast boosts digestive 

health and the immune system. 

  

**History of fermentation:**  

 

The art of fermentation, which is a New York time best seller, 

talks of fermentation as “anaerobic metabolism, the production of nutrients without 

oxygen” (3). The earliest instance of fermentation is said to have occurred through the 

metaphorical “prebiotic soup” two billion years ago when earth was inhabited solely by 

bacteria. This research that was done by Lynn Margulis has convinced many biologists of a 

symbiotic relationship between fermenting bacteria and other early single-celled 

organisms. This became permanently embodied as the first eukaryotic cells. Margulis 

believes this relationship started as predator and prey or playing cat and mouse. 

Fermentation serves a vast and crucial function in all of life, causing all beings, including 

humans, to evolve with it. 

  

**Anaerobic breakdowns:** 

 

In the 1920’s a discovery was made, and a name was given that 

changed the science of fermentation forever. It was found that when air is absent, extracts 

of muscle catalyze the formation of lactate from glucose. Additionally, the same 

intermediate compounds formed in the fermentation of grain are produced by muscle. A 

significant takeaway was made that fermentation reactions are not limited to yeast; 

glucose is used in many other reactions. 

 

**Glycolysis:**  

 

Simply put, this term is the breakdown of sugar. Originally it was defined as 

“the metabolism of sugar into lactate” (5) in the 1930s. A further definition can be drawn as 

fermentation characteristic of cells. “The process goes as follows: six-carbon sugar 

glucose is broken down into two molecules of the three-carbon organic acid (Pyruvic acid) 

with the transfer of chemical energy to the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). 

Pyruvic acid can be oxidized when in the presence of oxygen. This process is called 

 tricarboxylic cycle. Without the presence of oxygen, it could be reduced to lactic acid, 

alcohol, and other products. The sequence or process of glucose to pyruvate is called the 

Embden-Meyerhof” (5). It was named after two German biochemists who postulated and 

experimented on the reaction’s phases and processes in the late 1920’s and 1930’s. The 

term fermentation now means: “the enzyme-catalyzed, energy-yielding pathway in cells 

involving the anaerobic breakdown of molecules such as glucose” (5). 

 

**Different types of fermentation:**  

 

Many varied uses of fermentation have existed for centuries, to name a few: organic acids that come together to ferment vegetables and dairy, alcohol (beer, wine), bread is a product of fermentation. Statistically the most sold retail fermented products sold in the United States and Europe are cucumber pickles, olives, and sauerkraut. In Asian countries, a multitude of fermented vegetable productsare able be purchase, such as fermented cabbage, pickles and most notably kimchi in the South Korea region (1). Some of these products are able to be stored with no refrigeration and to be safely consumed. According to Fermented Vegetables – Food microbiology, “Prior to fermentation, fresh fruits and vegetables harbor a variety of microorganisms, including aerobic spoilage microflora such as Pseudomonas, Erwinia, and Enterobacter species, as well as yeasts and molds” (1). Additionally, when vegetables are brined, lactic acid bacteria are produced. The production of flora is important because it prevents 

overgrowth of bad flora and helps with boosting the immune system’s function. 

  

**Culture and fermentation:** 

 

Culture is sometimes used as a catch-all term to explain the 

microorganisms that convert milk into yogurt, as well as other kinds of culture like music 

and dance. A quote from The Art of Fermentation that embodies this well is, “Successful 

coexistence with microbes in our midst is a biological imperative, and the fermentation 

arts are human cultural manifestations of this essential fact” (3). If food is meant to be 

kept in substantial amounts people must find ways to preserve it which uses microbial 

ecology. Every culture has some form of fermentation. 

 

**Russian Culture and the influences of fermentation:**  

 

Russian culture heavily relies on fermentation. My mother grew up in Russia in the Soviet Union and Post-Soviet Union. At that time Russia was a struggling country and access to food was limited so to preserve what food they had access to; they would use fermentation. My mom recounts experiences from her childhood: 

  

“Cabbage in Russia has been fermented for many centuries. It is harvested 

in autumn and consumed all winter and spring. Cabbage is used to cook 

cabbage soup, solyanka, vinaigrettes, and bake pies with it. It is even dried. 

We used to get together as a family on the weekend at the end of September, 

and all day long we cut cabbage and grated carrots. It was kneaded with salt 

and placed in a barrel. In total, we prepared two large barrels. In the second 

barrel, we fermented quarters of cabbage with grated beets. It fermented for 

several days. Then we put it in jars and took it to the basement for storage. All 

winter long we ate cabbage with sunflower oil and onions, boiled cabbage 

soup, stewed with meat and fried. Without cabbage, it would be difficult to 

survive.” 

  


**Fermentation in nature:** 

 

Fermentation is not necessarily a human invention; it is more a 

natural phenomenon that people figured out how to cultivate. In China, rice and millet both 

complex carbohydrates which created digestive molds into simple sugars to make alcohol 

(3). In the “fertile crescent” of the middle east it was barley and wheat in a different 

process called malting that was used to digest them. Different countries have different 

crops but the same result. In colder climates fermentation is essential for survival where 

during the summer fish and other animals are caught and buried for months the product 

ferments to be dug up in a time of need during the winter (3). 

Fermentation and technology: Design factors are crucial for small-scale bioreactors. 

Bioreactors, in many different forms, have been around for thousands of years. Their uses 

were restricted to portable alcohol production. From the 1940’s and onwards 

“Fermentation as it is known today began to appear with the need to produce antibiotics 

during World War Two” (4). Because of the impracticality of carrying out some of this 

research on production scale equipment, small scale bioreactors became popular. The 

scale used is 1:20 liters. This scale is important because when bioreactors are used at this 

volume, many scale studies can be done as well as clone selection, process development 

and some forms of production. Bioreactors could be used to monitor pH and aseptic 

production for extended periods of time (4). 

 

**Sauerkraut at a closer look:** 

  

Food and chemical scientists from the American Chemical society studied sauerkraut at a molecular level. Looking closer at the formation of plant-derived during sauerkraut fermentation (6). The cabbage in the study was fermented using a starter culture and the results were compared with the results of spontaneous fermentation. They tested using twenty different flavonoids. Flavonoids are natural plant chemicals found in fruits, vegetables, and spices. They are essential for the body's intake of antioxidants and for the ability to produce anti-inflammatory properties. Of the twenty tested on one was found, kaempferol. The concertation of kaempferol remained constant throughout the entire fermentation process of sauerkraut. The nitrite (NO2) concentration was below the limit of detection in both cases of fermentation. Glucosinolates were completely decomposed in the experimental batches of sauerkraut. Alongside that many 

other types of breakdown products were formed. Glucosinolates are sulfur-containing 

compounds. They are found in cruciferous vegetables like kale, brussels sprouts, and 

broccoli. Out of the list of different breakdown products found the most noticeable were 

Isothiocyanates, nitriles, allyl cyanide, goitrin, and indole-3-carbinol (6). Isothiocyanates 

are created by the enzymatic conversion of glucosinolates. Nitriles are organic compounds 

that in other words are called cyano compounds. This class contains functional groups 

that contain cyanide. Allyl cyanide is an organic compound that has the formula 

CH2CHCH2CN (6). It is colorless and soluble in organic solvents. In certain polymers, allyl 

cyanide is used as a cross-linking agent and is found naturally as an antifeedant. 

Antifeedants are produced by plants to repel herbivores through toxicity or bad taste. 

Goitrin is an organosulfur compound that is derived from oxazolidine (C3H7NO) 

additionally it is also derived as a cyclic thiocarbamate. Goitrin is used to reduce the 

production of thyroid hormones such as thyroxine. Indole-3-carbinol is a substance that is 

produced by the body that helps break down glucobrassicin, which is a compound that 

can be found in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower. Indole-3-carbinol can 

be purchased in supplement home from any online retailer (6). 

 

 

**Conclusion:**  

 

Many aspects come together in the production and consumption of 

fermented foods. This paper was focused on fermented cabbage, better known as 

sauerkraut. Fermentation is essential for bioreactors, and technological evolution has 

caused a rise in technology essential in production of fermented foods. In many parts of 

the world, especially in Asia, it is a cultural staple. Fermenting food has allowed for 

centuries of tradition to be passed down through food. The chemical process behind 

fermenting cabbage is complicated and requires an understanding of chemistry and basic 

organic chemistry but it is essential to know why chemical reactions happen because it 

allows researchers and people to understand the importance of fermented food for the gut 

biome. It is beneficial for health and essential for longevity of life. People may overlook 

fermentation, but it is essential for health and quality of life.
