A basic introduction to the most prominent women in STEM from each field. Including: physics, environmental science, engineering, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, biology, medicine & health science.

**Environmental Science:**
The study of the relationships between humans, animals, and the natural world. In order to comprehend major issues like pollution, deforestation, and climate change, it integrates biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science. We wouldn't be able to combat problems like global warming, clean our air and water, or ensure that we had enough resources for the future without environmental research. The goal is to maintain the health of the planet for present and future generations.


**Rachel Carson**
Rachel Carson grew up in Pennsylvania and loved nature from an early age. She studied at Chatham University and later went on to earn a master’s degree in zoology from Johns Hopkins University.

Her biggest contribution was writing the book Silent Spring, which exposed the harmful effects of pesticides, especially DDT, on the environment. This book inspired people to care more about the planet and is often seen as the beginning of the modern environmental movement.

Carson was honored after her death with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the highest civilian awards in the United States.


**Wangari Maathai**
Wangari Maathai was born in Kenya in 1940. She studied abroad in the United States, then returned to Kenya, where she earned her Ph.D. in veterinary anatomy from the University of Nairobi, making her the first woman in East and Central Africa to earn a doctorate.

She founded the Green Belt Movement, which focused on planting trees to restore forests and empower women in local communities. Over 50 million trees have been planted because of her movement, which also encouraged people to protect natural resources.

In 2004, Maathai became the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize for her contributions to sustainable development and peace.


**Sylvia Earle**
Sylvia Earle was born in New Jersey in 1935 and grew up fascinated by the ocean. She studied at Florida State University for her undergraduate degree, then earned a Ph.D. in botany from Duke University.

She became a world-famous oceanographer and was the first female chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Earle has led more than 100 ocean research expeditions and has worked tirelessly to protect the world’s oceans.

She has been named a “Hero for the Planet” by Time magazine and continues to inspire people to care about marine life.


**Janine Benyus**
Janine Benyus was born in New Jersey and studied natural resource management and English literature at Rutgers University. Her background gave her a deep appreciation for both science and communication.

She is best known for popularizing the concept of biomimicry, which is about learning from nature to solve human problems. For example, studying how plants collect water from the air has helped scientists design better water systems.

Benyus co-founded the Biomimicry Institute, which helps spread these ideas around the world, inspiring both scientists and engineers.


These are but a handful of the ways that women in STEM have significantly influenced the modern world.  Their efforts demonstrate the potency of science when applied to safeguard both people and the environment.  Because it teaches us how to take care of the planet, manage resources, and create a better future for all, environmental science is important!



You’re probably wondering, “So how can I actually get involved in Environmental Science?” Well, there are tons of ways to jump into environmental science, and here are just a few that are perfect for high schoolers!

**Envirothon**
One of the best competitions for high school students is Envirothon, which I’ve personally experienced here in Florida. It’s a team-based competition where students study topics like forestry, soils, aquatics, wildlife, and current environmental issues. For me, Envirothon has been both fun and educational. I have learned so much about forestry and the different parts of environmental science, all while working with a team. It’s an amazing way to see how important these fields are in our changing world and to connect classroom knowledge with real life.


**School Environmental Clubs**
Joining or starting an environmental club at school is another way to dive into this field. Clubs often focus on projects like recycling programs, beach or park cleanups, and spreading awareness about sustainability. These activities might seem small, but they have a big impact on the local community! 


**Volunteering with Local Organizations**
Many cities have local nonprofits or conservation groups that need volunteers. This could mean helping plant trees, removing invasive species, or even assisting at wildlife centers. 


**Citizen Science Projects**
High schoolers can also participate in citizen science programs, where everyday people collect data that scientists use in research. For example, tracking bird migrations, monitoring water quality, or reporting on local air pollution.
