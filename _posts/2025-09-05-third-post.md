A basic introduction to the most prominent women in STEM from each field. Including: physics, environmental science, engineering, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, biology, medicine & health science.

**Physics:**
Starting with Physics, physics has many influential names that made it the discipline that it is today.

    **Marie Curie-**
Born in Poland in 1867. Moved to France to study science at the university of Paris(Sorbonne).
Contribution: Discovered radium and polonium. Leading pioneer in research on radioactivity
Recognition: First woman to win a nobel prize and the only person to ever win a nobel prize in chemistry and physics!

    **Lise Meitner-**
Born in Austria, she pursued a career in science despite gender barriers. She got her education at the University of Vienna
Contribution: Co-discovered nuclear fission
Recognition: Meitnerium, or Element 109, is named after her!

    **Maria Goeppert Mayer-**
Born in Kattowitz, Kingdom of Prussia then moved to the U.S. and attended University of Gottingen. She was intending to major in math but discovered her love for physics
Contribution: Developed nuclear shell model
Recognition: Nobel Prize in Physics

    **Jocelyn Bell Burnell-**
Born in Belfast, Northern Ireland and attended University of Glasgow where she received a bachelor's degree in physics. Later she attended the University of Cambridge where she was awarded a doctorate in radio astronomy.
Contribution: Discovered pulsars, which are cosmic sources of radio pulses.
Recognition: Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics, member of Royal Society, President of Royal Astronomical Society, President of the Institution of Physics for a two year term.

    **Vera Rubin**
Born in Philadelphia and attended Vassar College, which was then an all woman school. Later she applied to Princeton, but was rejected because of her gender. She was accepted to Harvard University but chose Cornell so she could be close to family. Later she attended Georgetown for her doctorate.
Contribution: An astronomer well known for research on the galaxy, rotation rates which proved the existence of dark matter.
Recognition: National Medal of Science, frequently mentioned as a candidate for the Nobel Prize. Carnegie Institution created a postdoctoral research fund in her honor. The AASâ€™s Divivsion of Dynamical Astronomy has named a prize in her honor.
