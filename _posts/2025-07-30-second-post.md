What is coding?

Coding is simply people telling computers what to do! Think of it like writing a recipe, but it's written in a way that computers can understand. While recipes or instructions tell you how to cook or build something, code tells computers how to open websites or run games. It’s how all websites and apps run. 


Why do we code?

We code to make computers do things for us! Just like people need tools to build a house, computers need code to build apps. Coding is a problem solver, it can automate tasks, and be used to create anything your heart desires. Every daily action like checking the weather or writing a text are all possible because of coding.


Different coding languages: What is each one for?

Ranked from Easiest to Hardest to learn.


Python:

Used for: AI, Games, Web Development.

Why it is easy: Readable like the English language!

Example:

print(“Hello, world!”)


JavaScript:

Used for: Making websites interactive, web apps, games.

Why it is easy: Runs in browsers, but syntax is a little harder than Python.

Example:

console.log(“Hello, world!”);


Ruby:
	
Used for: Web development.
	
Why it is medium: Easy to read, but not popular for beginners.
	
Example:

puts “Hello, world!”


Java:
	
Used for: Business software, Backend systems, Android apps.
	
Why it is medium: More code is required.
	
Example:

publics class Main {
	public static void main(String[] argos) {
		System.out.printLn(“Hello, world!”);
	}
}


C-Sharp(C#):
	
Used for: Games, Websites, Windows apps.
	
Why it is hard: Complex features.
	
Example:

using System;
	class Program {
		static void Main() {
			Console.WriteLine(“Hello, world!);
		}
	}


C++:
	
Used for: High-Performance Programs, Simulations, Game Engines.
	
Why it is hard: Complex Syntax and Manual Memory.
	
Example:

#include <iostream>
int main() {
	std : : count << “Hello, world!” << std : : endl;
	Return 0;
}


C:
	
Used for: Embedded Systems, Operating Systems.
	
Why it is very hard: Low-level control and lots of bugs.
	
Example:

#include <studio.h>
int main()  {
	printf(“Hello, world!/n”);
	return 0;
}


High School Classes Based on Coding:
Every High School is different but these are some class names to look out for if you want to get more into programming!

Introductory level classes:

*Intro to Computer Science
*Foundations of Programming
	
Intermediate/Advanced:
 
*Web Development
*Game Design & Development
*AP Computer Science Principles
*AP Computer Science A

Dual Enrollment/More Specialized:

History of Coding:

A brief history of the most important names and dates in the development of programming.

Timeline:

  1843- Ada Lovelace wrote the first ever algorithm.

Ada is considered to be the world's first programmer, she wrote it for Charles Babbage’s Analytical machine. The machine was never constructed but her notes imagined a future where computers did more than math.
	
  1936- Alan Turing proposed the Turing Machine.

Turing thought of a theoretical machine that could make any computer algorithm. This is the ground concept for modern programming and computing.
	
  1945- ENIAC is completed.
 
One of the first electronic computers, it was programmed by physically rewriting circuits. It was hardware manipulation, no programming languages involved yet.

  1952- Grace Hopper builds first compiler.
 
Grace created the A-O system, this translated very simple instructions into code that machines could process. Built the base for programming languages and it was very user-friendly.

  1957- FORTRAN is released
  
Short for “Formula Translation”, was the first programming language that was used by many people in science and engineering.
	
  1960- COBOL is created
  
Was created for a more business use, it resembled English and made it easier for people who weren't engineers to use it.

  1972- C programming language is created
  
At Bell Labs, Dennis Ritchie developed C. It was very efficient and flexible, it became the base for languages like Java, Python, C++.

  1990- Tim Berners-Lee invents World Wide Web
  
Created HTTP, HTML  and the first web browser! This changed how we use code by making the internet accessible.

  1991- Python is released
  
Guido Van Rossum creates Python. It was made to be easy to read and simple to learn and write. Currently, it's still one of the most popular languages for many different purposes.

  1995- Java and JavaScript introduced
  
James Gosling created Java, it was designed to be written once and be able to run everywhere. Brendan Eich created JavaScript, used for interactive web pages.

  2014- Apple released Swift
  
Language for iOS and macOS development. It is fast and very safe, it ended up replacing Objective-C in Apple ecosystems.

  2010s-now- Coding Powers AI
  
Python is responsible for most machine learning and AI. Coding is much more accessible now with so many different platforms like Github and Scratch, this helps people who are newer to coding to build actual projects!
