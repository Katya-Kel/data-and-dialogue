                <p>Hello! I'm Ekaterina Kelenina, but I also go by Katya. I'm a high school student passionate about sharing what I've learned from a variety of experiences. From internships to personal projects, this blog is my way of inviting you to explore topics that inspire me and hopefully spark your curiosity too.</p>
                
   <p>I will be writing about everything from computer science and AI to business and the fundamentals of reading. While my focus leans toward STEM, I also enjoy diving into humanities because I believe it is natural and exciting to have many interests.</p>
                
  <p>As I develop this space, I will make sure to cite my sources and provide links for anyone who wants to dig deeper. My hope is that you will find something here that resonates with you and encourages you to explore your own passions.</p>
                
   <p>Thanks for stopping by. Happy reading!</p>
